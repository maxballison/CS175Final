OS X

Provide instructions on how to compile and run your code, especially if you used a nonstandard Makefile, or you are one of those hackers who insists on doing things differently.

Same as given instructions for setup on mac

Indicate if you met all problem set requirements (more importantly, let us know where your bugs are and what you did to try to eliminate the bugs; we want to give you as much partial credit as we can).

Yes, we tested all cases of the mouse motion

Provide some overview of the code design. Don't go into details; just give us the big picture.

In our code, we expand upon the different 'modes' that we implemented in the last pset. We grab the eye coordinates of the point on the sphere in which the mouse is clicked, and rotate the arcball accordingly. This is all done within the initarcball, draw, and motion functions.

Let us know how to run the program; what are the hot keys, mouse button usage, and so on? Describe steps or sequences of steps the TF should take to test and evaluate your code (especially if your implmenentation strays from the assignment specification).

Our implementation is exactly the same as the project specification. Important keys are: V, O, and M

Finally, did you implement anything above and beyond the problem set? If so, document it in order for the TFs to test it and evaluate it.
